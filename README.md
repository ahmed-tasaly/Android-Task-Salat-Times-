* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) - As a programming language.
* [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - For multithreading while handling requests to the server and local database.
* [Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) - In coroutines, a flow is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value. For example, you can use a flow to receive live updates from a database.
* [Fused location provider](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/FusedLocationProviderClient.html) is one of the location APIs in Google Play services. It manages the underlying location technology and provides a simple API so that you can specify requirements at a high level, like high accuracy or low power. It also optimizes the device's use of battery power.
* [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) - To handle app navigation.
* [Model-View-ViewModel(MVVM)](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) - Offers an implementation of observer design pattern.
* [StateFlow](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-state-flow/) - Flow APIs that enable flows to optimally emit state updates and emit values to multiple consumers.
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java
* [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - It is arguably the most used Dependency Injection, or DI, framework for Android. Many Android projects use Dagger to simplify building and providing dependencies across the app. It gives you the ability to create specific scopes, modules, and components, where each forms a piece of a puzzle: The dependency graph.


* [Clean Architecture](https://www.raywenderlich.com/3595916-clean-architecture-tutorial-for-android-getting-started) - Applying Clean Architecture , Solid Principles and use cases  to build a robust, maintainable, and testable application.
I also wrote an article about How Clean Architecture maximizes the use of SOLID principles [here](https://github.com/kareemAboelatta/Social-media)
